# Bridging between Regulator and Energy Sector - Methane Emission Detection 

X-HEC Tech Challenge with Quantum Black, AI by McKinsey.

## Objective

The objective of the project is to develop an application capable of detecting methane leaks in satellite imagery to assist with MRV: monitoring, reporting, and verification

1. Provide service for energy companies in detecting methane leaks in satellite imagery to assist with MRV: monitoring, reporting, and verification, using deep learning models by Lab 5.

2. Develop a web app with functions dedicated for methane leakage prediction, data dashboard for enterprises and regulators.

## Current Build

The current build of the application is capable of image classification (methane plume or no methane plume) with Wide ResNet 50.
